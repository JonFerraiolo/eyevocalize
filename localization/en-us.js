# Welcome to EyeVocalize.com!

This website is a free, public version of a text-to-speech Web application that I wrote for myself
(an advanced ALS patient).
I included various features so that I can communicate quickly and efficiently
using only my eyes.

_**Few people will find this application useful.**_ This app might be useful if you, like me, are:
* Paralyzed in your arms and hands
* Unable to talk
* **Proficient in using eye gaze technology**,  such as the
[Tobii PC Eye Mini](https://www.tobiidynavox.com/en-us/devices/eye-gaze-devices/pceye-mini-access-windows-control/)

_**EyeVocalize is not designed for cell phones**_ and has not been tested on MacOS or Safari.

You run EyeVocalize in a browser tab,
which allows you to quickly switch between speech synthesis (using EyeVocalize),
other browser tabs (eg, web mail, search, calendar, chat, document authoring)
and other desktop applications (which for me is mostly programming tools).

EyeVocalize features:
* **Text-to-speech**: You can type text, then press Return (or click the speak icon) to cause the words to be spoken
using voice synthesis
* **Favorites**: You can define your own favorites for phrases that you use repeatedly, use the default set of favorites or import libraries of favorites
* **Notes**: You can prepare text in advance and
store in Notes for one-click speaking at just the right time
* **Video**: For fun, you can play YouTube clips, such as
"Houston, we have a problem"

To explore, press the Try It button at the top of this window.
To sign up as a user of EyeVocalize.com, press the Sign Up button, which unlocks
cross-device syncing and automatic cloud backup
(and removes annoying reminders).

About: `
# About EyeVocalize.com
EyeVocalize.com was created by me, Jon Ferraiolo, for my own use and then posted on the Web at EyeVocalize.com for free public use
in case it might be useful to others.

I have advanced ALS. As a result, I cannot speak or use my hands.
I had to learn to communicate with eye gaze technology.
I determined that the best match for me was the
[Tobii PC Eye Mini](https://www.tobiidynavox.com/en-us/devices/eye-gaze-devices/pceye-mini-access-windows-control/).
I practiced using the technology for months until I became proficient.

EyeVocalize is an advanced application with a ton of features that I wrote it for my own needs and my own particular setup.
It is available for others to use on an as is basis with absolutely no guarantees of suitability or correctness.
Oher users will probably need to have
a high level of skill with eye gaze and a similar computer setup to me:

* A Microsoft Surface laptop running Windows 10.
* [Tobii PC Eye Mini](https://www.tobiidynavox.com/en-us/devices/eye-gaze-devices/pceye-mini-access-windows-control/)
with Windows Control 2.0 from Tobii Dynavox (eye gaze technology)
* Chrome, Firefox or Edge, latest version

I am alive today but far into my decline.
Theoretically, the site should keep running forever after I go, but in reality Web sites require periodic maintenance.
When EyeVocalize goes down and I am not around to fix it, it is probably gone forever.

The only user support mechanism is email to [EyeVocalize@EyeVocalize.com](mailto:EyeVocalize@EyeVocalize.com)
which currently redirects to me. If anyone is interested in taking over EyeVocalize.com,
please send email to [EyeVocalize@EyeVocalize.com](mailto:EyeVocalize@EyeVocalize.com).

The source code is open source available at https://github.com/JonFerraiolo/eyevocalize.
A capable Web programmer who knows about site administration should be able to take over
the code and the site, or host the app on a different domain.

The Web site uses Nodejs on the server and uses a MySQL database. The Web site was developed with the attempt to follow
Web programming best practices, particularly around security,
but the site is hosted on a shared Web hosting service; I don't know everything; time was a scarce resource; and I make mistakes.
The application has a ton of features and I did my best
to make sure everything works, but I know
it has to have hundreds of bugs.
I hope none of the bugs affects you.

# Privacy Policy

EyeVocalize.com does not share any user information with third parties.

User account information is stored on a server database that theoretically is private to EyeVocalize.com. However, EyeVocalize.com is hosted on a cheap shared Web hosting service which, while it has a reputation for trustworthiness, the technical personnel could violate rules and figure out how to look at the database if they so wanted.

The only personal identification information that is stored on the server are your email and an encrypted password, which are stored in the database.

By default, users with accounts will have their History, Notes and Favorites stored in the server database for the purposes of cross-device synchronization and cloud backup. There is an option under account settings to turn the cloud storage feature off.
The user data will not be looked at or used in any way except for the previously mentioned purposes.

The one exception is that there is a user interface option under account settings that allows EyeVocalize.com developers to look at your data. This option is off by default. If you turn it on, then you give EyeVocalize.com developers the right to look at your data only for the purpose of improving the product, particularly new built-in favorites.

EyeVocalize.com has a couple of automatic backup mechanisms for the rare cases of server disk crashes or the hosting company going
out of business with no data preservation. Snapshots of your server data will be stored within these backups even if you close your account.

# Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies

EyeVocalize.com does not share cookie information with third parties.

EyeVocalize.com uses cookies only for session management, where a random number that represents the session ID is stored in a cookie. This is kept private to the EyeVocalize.com server.

There is another browser technology with some similarities to cookies called Local Storage.  Local Storage information is stored in a secure location on your local disk and is not shared with third parties. EyeVocalize.com uses Local Storage for performance reasons and so that the application will continue to work even when the computer is offline.

      <p>At the top of the main screen of the application, you should see a large text input box with a type-in cursor.</p>
      <p>Bring up the onscreen keyboard from your eye gaze system. (For example, I have a Tobii Dynavox PC Eye Mini. The onscreen keyboard is part of their Windows Control software.) </p>
      <p>Type what you want to say. </p>
      <p>Press Return or click the <icon2>speak</icon2> speak icon to cause speech synthesis to vocalize using the current system voice. </p>
      <p>There is a Voice section on the <topic>Settings</topic> screen, available from the <icon2>gear</icon2> gear icon at the top of the application. Depending on your browser, you might be able to be able to change voices, rate and pitch. </p>

    HistoryContent: `
      <p>The History is on the left side of the application under Notes.</p>
      <p>Everything you vocalize is recorded in the History. </p>
      <p>To repeat a vocalization, click on the entry within the History.  </p>
      <p><strong>Control-period</strong> (Control plus the "." character) will repeat the most recent vocalization.  </p>
      <p>On the History title bar is a <icon1>editicon</icon1> pencil icon. If you click that icon, you go to the <strong>Manage History</strong> screen where you can search, delete and copy entries from the History to the system clipboard. </p>
      <p>On the Manage History screen, there is also a <strong>Scroll To</strong> button. This is useful for copying a sequence of vocalizations to the system clipboard. The usual sequence is to search for an entry, select that entry, click the <strong>Scroll To</strong> button to show the contemporaneous entries, multi-select desired entries and then click the <strong>Copy</strong> to copy the entries to the system clipboard, reordered in the order they were originally spoken. </p>
      <p>There is a History section on the <topic>Settings</topic> screen, available from the <icon2>gear</icon2> gear icon at the top of the application. </p>
    `,
    Favorites: `Favorites`,
    FavoritesContentsDesc: `Your favorite vocalizations`,
    FavoritesContent: `
      <p>Your list of Favorites takes up three columns of the application.</p>
      <p>Favorites are things you say regularly that you want to be only a single click away.</p>
      <p>To vocalize a favorite, simply click on that  entry.  </p>
      <p>When you open the application initially, you will see a minimal list of default Favorites. Sometime soon after you start to use EyeVocalize, set aside a block of time to build your list of things you say regularly and add those things to your Favorites.   </p>
      <p>You can import a collection of Favorites using the <icon1>import</icon1> import icon on the Favorites title bar. For example, there are collections of Favorites labeled "ALS" on the EyeVocalize website that you might want to import if you have ALS like me. You can import **From** one three types of sources: an EyeVocalize collection, or a URL or your local file system if the target file is the correct format. </p>
      <p>On the Favorites title bar is a <icon1>addicon</icon1> plus icon, which is one way to define a new favorite. You can also create favorites by typing text into the input text box and clicking the <icon2>heart</icon2> heart icon at the top of the application. </p>
      <p>On the Favorites title bar is a <icon1>editicon</icon1> pencil icon. If you click that icon, you go to the <strong>Manage Favorites</strong> screen where you can add, edit, delete and reorder both individual favorites but also the categories.  </p>

      <p>EyeVocalize by default only uses the top part of the screen and reserves the bottom of the screen for the onscreen keyboard. (The onscreen keyboard is provided by the eye gaze system.)  </p>
      <p>When the application only uses the top part of the screen, the app is in half-page mode.  </p>
      <p>For those times when you don't need the keyboard, you can toggle between half-page and full-page mode. </p>
      <p>If you are in half-page mode, the <icon2>halfpage</icon2> half-page icon  appears both in the top right icon bar and also in the dark bottom half of the screen (active in both places). Clicking on the half-page icon will switch to full-page.  </p>
      <p>If you are in full-page mode, the <icon2>fullpage</icon2> full-page icon  appears in the icon bar. Clicking on the full-page icon will switch to half-page. </p>

      <p>Then, either press the <icon2>search</icon2> search icon or press Control-s on the keyboard.  </p>
      <p>After triggering the search, the screen will filter your <topic>Notes</topic>, <topic>History</topic> and <topic>Favorites</topic> to only show entries that match one of the search strings. </p>

      <p>The cross-device synchronization feature obviously only makes sense for users with at least two eye gaze systems; for example, one eye gaze system on your wheelchair and another on your bed.  </p>
      <p>You can turn off the cloud backup and synchronization features by clicking on the <icon2>gear</icon2> Settings icon and then going to the Account tab. There is a checkbox that enables/disables the sync feature.  </p>
