      <p>I, Jon Ferraiolo, a person who cannot speak or use his hands, created this application for my own use so I can not only communicate with my family and caregivers, but also participate as normally as possible in social activities. Although I tailored the software for my own needs, I tried to write the software so that others could use it, too. There are many other text-to-speech systems. I do not expect very many people will choose this application, but if you like it, great, use it. It is free with no restrictions other than don't do illegal or bad things listed in the Terms of Use. </p>
      <p>The biggest difference between Eyevocalize and older text-to-speech systems is that it runs in a browser tab. That allows you to easily transition between Web mail, Facebook, Twitter, Web browsing, Web music, streaming video, etc., and your text-to-speech application, including copy/paste to/from each. </p>
      <p>My particular computer setup has:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A Microsoft Surface laptop (because Tobii Dynavox software requires Windows) with a current version of Windows 10. The Surface hangs about 18" in front of me. (I actually have two nearly identical systems, one for my wheelchair and one hanging over my head in bed.)</li>
        <li>PC Eye Mini with Windows Control 2.0</li>
        <li>Chrome, Firefox or Edge. I mostly use Chrome, but I have found no problems with Firefox and Edge so far. In fact, the other two seem to work better for speech synthesis. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>EyeVocalize will only be useful to people who not only have a similar technology stack, but also have a high level of proficiency using their eyes to do ordinary computer tasks such as clicking, typing and scrolling. </p>
      <p>EyeVocalize is alpha software that is maintained by me, and I am a terminally ill patient who could go at any time. The website should just keep working until it doesn't, for whatever reason. If I am not around to fix, that will probably be the end of EyeVocalize. </p>
